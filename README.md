Python Labs for OpenIntro Statistics
==============

This repository is a collection of lab files to teach how to perform statistical data analysis with Python based on [OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/book/os/), a free and open-source textbook. 

These labs have been put together by Imran Ture and Vural Aksakalli for OpenIntro.

The lab files are processed using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).
