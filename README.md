Python Labs for OpenIntro Statistics
==============

This repository is a collection of lab files to teach how to perform statistical data analysis with Python based on [OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/book/os/), a free and open-source textbook. 

The lab files are processed using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

Additional practice Python exercises (including solutions) for each OpenIntro Statistics chapter can be found [here](https://github.com/imranture/practice_stats/).
